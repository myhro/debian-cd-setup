Modified CONF.sh to adapt it to our settings and tried to use on it only
relative paths so that we could relocate all the stuff

The script testingcds calls build.sh and after the things are built it finishes
them and publishes.


OLD stuff that was used at gluck, not here:
Installed localy using dpkg -x: jigdo-file, delo and mkisofs

Binary utils I have compiled and installed in bin: genisovh isomarkboot

When building only binaries I had removed at debian-cd-jte/build.sh the
"make mirrorcheck-source"
