<h1>What's in this directory?</h1>

<p>These are files containing the cloud image of the Debian GNU/Linux
operating system designed for OpenStack.

The files in this directory are specifically for
the <code>amd64</code> architecture.</p>

<h2>How do I use these files?</h2>

<p>The files here are qcow2 or raw images, ready to use.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the image, you would typically need to
upload it to Glance, using a command like this one:</p>

<pre>glance image-create --name="Debian Jessie 64-bit" \
	--disk-format=qcow2 --container-format=bare \
	--property architecture=x86_64 \
        --progress \
	--file debian-8.0.0-openstack-amd64.qcow2</pre>

<p>Then you can boot a new virtual machine instance using the uploaded
image ID.</p>

<h2>Will the image work on another cloud platform than OpenStack?</h2>

<p>If your platform supports the EC2 style metadata server (which is
contacted by cloud-init), and also supports an HDD image (using either
raw or qcow2 format), then most likely it will work. Note that it will
not work on Amazon EC2 if you are not using the HVM mode.</p>


<h2>How can I verify my download is correct and exactly what has been
   created by Debian?</h2>

<p>There are files here (MD5SUMS, SHA1SUMS, etc.) which contain
checksums of the images. These checksum files are also signed - see
MD5SUMS.sign, SHA1SUMS.sign, etc. Once you've downloaded an image, you
can check:</p>

<ul>
   <li>that its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and
   <li>that the checksum file has not been tampered with.
</ul>

<p>For more information about how to do these steps, read
the <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/verify">verification guide</a>.
